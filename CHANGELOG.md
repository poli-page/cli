## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-26

### Changed
- Bumped minimum required Node.js version from `>=22.0.0` to `>=22.13.0`.
  Aligns the declared engine with the actual requirement of
  `@inquirer/prompts@8.4.2`, which needs Node `^22.13.0` (or newer LTS
  branches). Users on Node 22.12 or earlier will now get a clear engine
  warning at install time instead of cascading dependency warnings.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- `poli init` now scaffolds `partials/`, `assets/fonts/`, and `assets/images/`
  directories alongside the existing `templates/` and `assets/`. Aligns the
  scaffolded layout with the standard project structure used by the editor.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Initial public release on npm under the `@poli-page` scope.
- `poli init` — scaffold a new project with manifest, `tailwind.css`, and
  standard directories.
- `poli new` — create templates from one of six layout models (blank,
  header-main-footer, header-sidebar-main-footer, header-main-sidebar-footer,
  sidebar-header-main-footer, header-main-footer-sidebar).
- `poli render` — render a template to PDF locally or via the cloud API.
- `poli login` / `poli logout` / `poli whoami` — device authorization flow
  authentication, credentials stored in `~/.poli-page/credentials.json`.
- `poli link` / `poli unlink` — associate a local project with a cloud
  organization.
- `poli publish` — sync a local project and publish a new version.
- `poli versions list` / `poli versions download` — manage published versions.
- `poli thumbnail` — generate page thumbnail images via the cloud API.
